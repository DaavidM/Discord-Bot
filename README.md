# Discord-Bot
A Discord bot (nicknamed "The Shooter") written in C# using the Discord.NET Unofficial wrapper.  It features basic moderation features, such as channel renaming and kicking/banning.  The name of the bot was based off of the name of the text channel.  No real thought was poured into it.

It's still a work-in-progress and features consistent updates.  After I've finished cleaning up the code and adding more features, I'll publicize the bot more for educational purposes.

Planning on:
1. Adding a mathematics module with LaTeX built in.
This module should be able to solve basic mathematics problems.
2. Streamlining the moderation features.
3. Streamlining the help/command menu.
4. Adding a gaming component to it.
5. Adding a music portion to it.

Will add commands/help documentation soon.
